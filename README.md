## Features and Bugs

Please add your Gradle Plugin Portal bug reports or feature requests by opening an [issue](https://github.com/gradle/plugin-portal-requests/issues/new/choose).
This is also applicable to the [Gradle Plugin Publishing plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.plugin-publish).

## Help with the plugin portal

### Deleting a plugin or version

If you've published a version of your plugin to the plugin portal and you need to remove it, you have 7 days from the time the plugin is published to delete it. After that, you will need to open an [issue](https://github.com/gradle/plugin-portal-requests/issues/new/choose). Please let us know which plugin and version you would like to delete and how we can verify that you're the owner of the plugin.

We really want to avoid deleting existing plugins when possible since this may break existing builds. If you've stopped development on your plugin or have published it under a new name, please open an [issue](https://github.com/gradle/plugin-portal-requests/issues/new/choose) and we can mark the plugin deprecated and point users to the new plugin.

### Transferring ownership

If you've handed development of a plugin to someone else, we can transfer that plugin to the new account.

Open an [issue](https://github.com/gradle/plugin-portal-requests/issues/new/choose) and provide:
- A link to the plugin to be transferred
- Who you would like to transfer the plugin to (user name or link to their user profile)

You may need to provide proof you're the current owner. 

### Changing links, tags or description

To change the links, tags or description of your plugin, open an [issue](https://github.com/gradle/plugin-portal-requests/issues/new/choose) with a link to the plugin and what changes you would like to see.

### Changing account information

If you need to delete your user account or change the email associated with it, please open an [issue](https://github.com/gradle/plugin-portal-requests/issues/new/choose).

If you'd like to keep your email private, please email us at plugin-portal-support@gradle.com.
